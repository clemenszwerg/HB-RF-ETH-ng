### Known Security Issues

#### ⚠️ Parcel Development Server Vulnerability (CVE-2025-56648)

**Status**: UNPATCHED (as of December 12, 2025)

**Severity**: Moderate (CVSS 6.5)

**Description**:
The Parcel development server has an origin validation error vulnerability (GHSA-qm9p-f9j5-w83w) that affects versions 1.6.1 through 2.16.3. This vulnerability allows malicious websites to send XMLHTTPRequests to the local development server and potentially steal source code when developers visit those sites.

**Affected Component**: `@parcel/reporter-dev-server`

**Root Cause**:
1. Insecure CORS configuration (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`)
2. Missing Host header validation
3. Vulnerability to DNS rebinding attacks

**Impact**:
- Only affects the **development environment**
- Production builds are NOT affected
- Risk exists only when developers run `npm run dev` and visit untrusted websites

**Mitigation**:
While no official patch is available yet, follow these security practices:

1. **Development Environment Security**:
   - Only visit trusted websites while running the development server
   - Stop the development server when not actively developing
   - Use a separate browser profile for development
   - Consider using a firewall to restrict access to localhost:1234

2. **Production Builds**:
   - Production builds (`npm run build`) are NOT affected
   - The vulnerability only exists in the development server

**Current Status**:
We have updated to the latest available version (2.16.3), which is currently the most recent release. We are monitoring for security patches from the Parcel team.

## Firmware Security Recommendations

### Default Credentials

**IMPORTANT**: The firmware ships with a default admin password (`admin`).

**Action Required**:
- **IMMEDIATELY** change the default admin password after first boot
- Access the WebUI and navigate to Settings
- Set a strong, unique password
- Recommended: Use 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols

### Monitoring Configuration

The firmware currently supports monitoring via **MQTT** and **CheckMK**.

**Recommendations**:
- Restrict CheckMK access to trusted hosts only
- Use strong credentials for MQTT brokers
- Prefer isolated network segments for management and monitoring traffic
- Disable monitoring services that are not needed in production

### Network Security

**Best Practices**:
- Deploy the device on a trusted/isolated network segment
- Use firewall rules to restrict access to necessary ports only
- Regularly check for firmware updates
- Monitor the device logs for suspicious activity

### Authentication Token

The WebUI uses a secure token-based authentication system:
- Tokens are generated using ESP32's hardware random number generator
- Tokens are hashed using SHA-256
- Tokens are unique per device (includes serial number)
- Tokens expire on device reboot
